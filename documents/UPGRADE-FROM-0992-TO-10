UPGRADE
-------
Upgrade to playSMS version 1.0-beta1 from unmodified playSMS version 0.9.9.2

Assumed that your old playSMS (0.9.9.2) was installed like this:
- Your playSMS 0.9.9.2 web location is in /var/www/playsms/
- Your playSMS 0.9.9.2 daemon files location are in /usr/local/bin/
- Your playSMS 0.9.9.2 database name is 'playsms'

And, assumed that your new playSMS (1.0-beta1) was extracted at:
- /usr/local/src/playsms

Follow below steps carefully to upgrade from unmodified 0.9.9.2 to 1.0-beta1:

1. Stop playsmsd and sendsmsd:

	/etc/init.d/playsms stop

2. Move and backup old files and database (please note on the 'slash'):

	mkdir -p /root/backup-0.9.9.2
	cd /root/backup-0.9.9.2
	mkdir www bin etc db
	mv /var/www/playsms/* www/
	mv /usr/local/bin/playsms* /usr/local/bin/sendsms* bin/
	mysqldump -uroot -p playsms --add-drop-table > db/playsms.sql
	cp /etc/default/playsms etc/playsms
	cp /etc/init.d/playsms etc/playsms.init

3. Quick install new files and copy old config.php:

	cd /usr/local/src/playsms
	cp -rR web/* /var/www/playsms/
	cp -rR daemon/linux/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
	cp /root/backup-0.9.9.2/www/config.php /var/www/playsms/

4. Update database:

	cd /usr/local/src/playsms
	mysql -uroot -p playsms < db/playsms-upgrade-0992-to-10.sql

5. Start again playsmsd and sendsmsd:

	/etc/init.d/playsms start

6. Upgrade complete, browse playSMS as usual.
